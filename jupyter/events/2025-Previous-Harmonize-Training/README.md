## Overview
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">
This previous aims to present practically the data and tools available to access the data produced in the context of the Earth Observation Data Cube tuned for Health Response Systems (EODCtHRS) component of the HARMONIZE project.

This training introduces participants to the essential components of the Harmonize ecosystem, beginning with the field protocols adopted by the LabDrones team and followed by an overview of the project deliverables, software packages and tools. It then presents the structure and purpose of the BDC-Lab and guides participants through the installation of the cube4health framework. The program advances into the processing modules dedicated to drone, climate and health data, illustrating how each dataset is harmonized within the EODCtHRS environment. Finally, it covers the infrastructure requirements for data publication and concludes with an integrated case study that demonstrates the access, visualization and analysis of drone, health, climate and satellite data in a unified workflow.

The EODCtHRS is based on the integration and interoperability between a specific set of attention data (climate reanalysis, forecast, socioeconomic, demographic, health, disease surveillance data and high-resolution drone images) and the digital infrastructure of the Brazil Data Cube (BDC) Project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), in particular with the Earth Observation datasets of the Brazil. The main result of this component is a software-based platform that allows the creation and deployment of multidimensional data cubes tailored for use in health response systems.



## Consortium
[The HARMONIZE consortium](https://www.harmonize-tools.org/about-us/consortium) comprises 7 institutions from across Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe, with expertise in public health, Earth observation and the development of early warning tools to forecast outbreaks of climate-sensitive infectious diseases.

Coordinated by Barcelona Super Computer Center (BSC), we have the following Brazilian institutions:
